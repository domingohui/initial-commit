## Initial Commit

I made this little app to learn about vue js and simple api scraping.

Fire up ```index.html``` to get rollin'

Or go to [https://domingohui.github.io/initial-commit/](https://domingohui.github.io/initial-commit/)

### Production mode
Change 
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue"></script>
```
in ```index.html``` to
```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@[$version]/dist/vue.min.js"></script>
```


#### TODO

- [ ] Work on CSS
- [ ] Clear button
